		Math-DVector package

	Copyright (C) Tuomas J. Lukka 1996

This package provides a simple vector of double implemented in C++
for speed. It is usable both from perl and C++, making it possible
to pass arguments to XS subroutines using these objects.

The Neural::* modules use this class as their basis.
