		Neural package

	Copyright (C) Tuomas J. Lukka 1996

  This is an alpha version of the Neural::* package, currently
containing only a small subset of the complete Neural suite that
is partly implemented, partly planned.

  This package contains enough code to do pretty fast back-propagation with
arbitrarily large networks and define new group types.

  The GUI is currently excluded because it is undergoing a change.

  You need the blib package from Tk-b11.02 to use the tests.

  The Math::DVector and Parametrized -packages are included for completeness.

  I have not yet quite worked out how to use MakeMaker and XSUBs and C++:
the problems are:
 -Neural::Basic and Math::DVector: -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib... SUCKS.
 -Neural::Basic: BasicGroups.c.PL generates many different files.
      how to correctly do this?

Often, this is fixed by doing perl Makefile.PL again in the root directory
and then rerunning make. I really would like to see a solution for
these problems.


See also the README files in the subdirectories and the INSTALL -file.

There are some examples in Neural-Basic/examples/
